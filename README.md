TASK-02:

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

Sample Dataset :- https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

DESCRIPTION:

This involved performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset. The dataset used in this task contained information about a certain variable, which could be either categorical or continuous.

During data cleaning, missing values were handled, and the dataset was formatted appropriately for analysis. This involved imputing missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and ensuring the data types were correct.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) was then conducted to gain insights into the distribution and relationships within the dataset. Various visualizations and statistical summaries were used to explore the data, identify patterns, and understand the characteristics of the variable under consideration.

Overall, the goal of Task-02 was to understand the dataset better, uncover any interesting patterns or trends, and prepare the data for further analysis or modeling.
